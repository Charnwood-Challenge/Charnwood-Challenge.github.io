A big thanks to all those who helped to run the event for 2021.

We could not have done it without all of the volunteers, who marshalled, served refreshments, set the course out, serving water and supporting around the course.

From Scouts, Explorers, Scout group leaders, who spent many hours organising behind the scenes, to clearing the course, and being there to help today to make this event run smoothly.

Thanks to all the walkers and runners who completed the Challenge across some of the most challenging paths across Charnwood.

And thanks also to the landowners along the route who very kindly gave permission for use of the Permissive Path and the final fields and helped with access, together with Charnwood Borough Council and Leicestershire County Council.
