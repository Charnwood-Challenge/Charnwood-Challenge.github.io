title: Update

A slightly belated 'Happy New Year' to all our Charnwood Challenge supporters, and for those of you who are starting to formulate plans for 2020, just a quick update that we are looking at a provisional date of Sunday 20th September for this year's event - we should be in a position to confirm this soon, with more details to follow when entries open.
(And apologies that we are currently having some difficulties with our website, which we hope to resolve shortly.)
