title: Remembering HM The Queen
---

We are deeply saddened at the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who was the Patron of Scouts and a keen supporter of the movement, and our thoughts are with the Royal Family at this time. 

We are currently planning for the Charnwood Challenge to go ahead, and acknowledge that many people in the community will want to mark this time in a reflective and meaningful manner.  We therefore encourage everyone taking part to be mindful of the circumstances in which the event is taking place, and to communicate their respect in a manner which they feel is appropriate. 

Further details of how we will collectively mark this occasion at the event will be provided on the day.
