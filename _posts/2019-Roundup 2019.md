ROUND UP 2019

Firstly, a huge thank you to all entrants in this year’s Charnwood Challenge and the Junior Challenge from the organising team and Nanpantan Scouts. Thank you also for the positive comments afterwards from the people we spoke with, and posted online since. We hope that you enjoyed the day as much as the organisers and marshals did - your support will have provided a much needed boost in fundraising efforts towards improving the group's headquarters building.

Having seen the weather forecast in the days leading up to the event, especially with such a nice day on the Saturday, we were a little concerned whether the rain might dampen spirits for the event. However, we were extremely lucky in that the worst seemed to come just before things got going in the morning, and then after everyone was safely back.

If you haven’t looked at them already, the results for the main event have been posted on the event website: www.charnwoodchallenge.org.uk . We have decided this year not to publish the results for the Junior Challenge in full, but positions for individuals can be confirmed by contacting the organisers via Facebook or the event website. Well done to all the prizewinners.

There are a number of other people and organisations to thank without whom the event would not have been possible:
- The various landowners and stakeholders who supported the event:
- Holywell Farm - Richard Smith
- Bawdon Lodge Farm - Richard Bailey
- Home Farm - Graham, Matt, Chris and Marie
- Leicestershire County Council – James Lovatt and the other rangers at Broombriggs and Beacon Hill
- Charnwood Borough Council
- Nottinghamshire Emergency Scout Support Team (NESST) for providing first aid cover
- The café team and their army of cake bakers
- The marshals around the course (including the runner who stepped in to help after having already finished his race)
- The Leaders, Scouts and Explorers who helped with the water station and marshalling at Broombriggs
- Joe Putt (and others) for clearing the 'missing link' track and taking photographs
- The Scout Leaders and other volunteers helping out around the hut
- Scouts, Cubs and Beavers who helped with marshalling and the prizegiving
- Scout parents who helped promote the event and made the prizes
- Those walkers who raised additional funds through personal sponsorship
- Barrow Runners for loan of the signage and other bits
- Woodgate Financial Management who kindly sponsored the event badges
- Loughborough University and their Security team for the parking at Holywell Park

Lastly, well done to all those who completed the main Challenge event and Junior Challenge, and we look forward to (perhaps) welcoming you all back again next year!
