Still time to enter for the big race, so don’t delay. The spread of runners from different clubs across Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and beyond is really good to see.

Just a quick reminder/update on a few things to be aware of regarding the event:

## Event HQ
The event will start and finish at the Nanpantan Scout Group HQ on Nanpantan Road in Loughborough (LE11 3YE - however please see information below relating to parking).
The facilities at the HQ will be open from 8:00 on the day of the event.

## Parking
As the road past the scout hut can be fairly busy we have made arrangements to use the Loughborough University Holywell Park carpark for event parking where there should be plenty of space (Postcode: LE11 3GR – use West campus entrance from main roundabout on Ashby Road). Although by road this may seem some distance from the event, by following the marked route through the local estate it is only around a 15 minute walk (1 km / 0.6 miles) to the event HQ. For safety reasons and to avoid causing problems with local residents we therefore kindly request that competitors use this facility rather than parking on nearby streets. Please take care when crossing the road to/from the Scout HQ.
The carpark will be open from 8:00 on the day of the event.
For any people who have entered the event as a 'walker' then there is the option to park at the slightly nearer Nanpantan sports ground off Watermead Lane (LE11 3TN). However, please be aware that this is a public carpark shared with several sports groups, and there may not be much free space. To avoid creating problems with other users and local residents, if this carpark is full then please use the university carpark as above.

## Registration
Registration will open at 8:30 for collection of race numbers and any last minute queries.

## Start Times

The start times for the event are as follows:

9:00 Walkers
10:00 Runners
10:30 Junior Challenge

## Route
The route for the 10 mile event can be found here: www.plotaroute.com/route/662696
Maps of the confirmed route will be available for viewing at the Event HQ on the morning of the event.
As the route is primarily on paths and tracks which may be muddy, rocky and steep, then off-road / trail running shoes with good grip are strongly recommended.
The route will be partly marked, with signs at key points and tape streamers along the paths, together with marshals at key points.
Marshalls will be positioned at road crossings to help ensure the safety of competitors, but please be aware that they are not permitted to stop traffic, just to indicate when it may be safe to cross. Please be sure to follow any instructions given.
Note that there are a few places on the route where there are nettles and brambles along the tracks and, while we have tidied up the worst of these, if this is likely to cause a problem we suggest that you wear long leg running tights, or trousers for the walkers.

## Water
There will be a water station just over halfway round the course (at approximately 5.5 miles / 9 km) on the approach to the Broombriggs carpark.
If the weather is expected to be unseasonably hot then additional water will be provided at other locations. Walkers may wish to carry their own water bottle, and there is also a water fountain just off the route at the Upper Beacon Hill carpark toilets if needed.
Water will also be provided at the Scout HQ after the finish, but as we are attempting to reduce plastic usage this will be in reusable plastic cups, or we would be more than happy to fill your own water bottle for you.

## Refreshments
Refreshments will be available to purchase at the Scout HQ before and after the event, including tea, coffee, soft drinks, cake, and a selection of other snacks.

## Changing and Toilets
Toilets will be provided at the event HQ, but note that these are limited, so please plan ahead where possible.
During the event itself, please note that there are public toilets at several points close to the route (i.e. top or bottom of Beacon Hill, Woodhouse Eaves village), although a short detour may be needed – please ask a marshal for directions if necessary.

## Bag Storage
Bag storage will be situated in the scout HQ meeting room. You will need to show your race number to pick up your bag after the race.

## Prizes
All finishers of the 10 mile event will receive a bespoke embroidered 'scout' badge, and prizes will also be awarded in the following categories:
Runners - 1st, 2nd, and 3rd male; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd female
Walkers – 1st male, 1st female (Please be aware that any walkers observed running, or admitting to (!), will be reclassified.)
Prizegiving will be as soon as possible after each event has finished, around 12 noon for the runners, and 1pm for the walkers.

## Junior Challenge / Fun Run
The ‘Charnwood Junior Challenge’ will be a 1 mile (1.6 km) fun run/walk on an off-road route for children and anyone else who fancies a shorter challenge, and starts at 10.30am. This a challenging cross country course, so don't expect to keep your feet dry!
Please note that all children under 8 must be accompanied by a person 18 or over.
Children (and adults) can enter on the day at a cost of £3.00 per person (adults accompanying children: free)
All finishers will receive a special Charnwood Challenge medal, and there will also be prizes for the 1st boy and 1st girl in the Under 8, 8 to 10, and 11+ categories, with prizegiving around 11am.

## First Aid and Emergencies
For any first aid or other emergencies experienced while at the scout HQ, please inform a marshal.
First aid cover on the course and at the event HQ will be provided by experienced first aiders.
As sections of the route are rural, rough underfoot, and remote from the road, in the event of an accident or a runner becoming unwell, please stop to provide assistance if necessary, and ensure that a marshal located at one of the road crossings is informed of the situation as soon as possible.
In the unfortunate situation that you are unable to finish the event and need to retire, please make you way to the nearest road crossing, and inform the marshal located there, who will be able to provide assistance.

## Late entries
If you have any friends who are yet to enter then we will be taking entries up until Saturday evening if we haven't reached our limit (and maybe even on the day).

Thanks again for your support!
