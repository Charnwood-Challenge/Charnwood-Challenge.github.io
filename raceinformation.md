# On the Day

Registration 

Registration will open at 8:30 for collection of race numbers and any last minute queries. 

Start Times 

The start times for the event are as follows: 

 9:00  Walkers 

 10:00 Runners  

 10:30 Junior Challenge 

 

Water 

There will be a water station just over halfway round the course (at approximately 5.5 miles / 9 km) on the approach to the Broombriggs carpark.

If the weather is expected to be unseasonably hot then additional water will be provided at other locations.  Walkers may wish to carry their own water bottle, and there is also a water fountain just off the route at the Upper Beacon Hill carpark toilets if needed.

Water will also be provided at the Scout HQ after the finish, but as we are attempting to reduce plastic usage this will be in reusable plastic cups, or we would be more than happy to fill your own water bottle for you.

 

Refreshments 

Refreshments will be available to purchase at the Scout HQ before and after the event, including tea, coffee, soft drinks, cake, and a selection of other snacks. 

 

Changing and Toilets 

Toilets will be provided at the event HQ, but note that these are limited, so please plan ahead where possible.

During the event itself, please note that there are public toilets at several points close to the route (i.e. top or bottom of Beacon Hill, Woodhouse Eaves village), although a short detour may be needed – please ask a marshal for directions if necessary. 

 

Bag Storage 

Bag storage will be situated in the scout HQ meeting room.  You will need to show your race number to pick up your bag after the race. 

 

Prizes 

All finishers of the 10 mile event will receive a bespoke embroidered 'scout' badge, and prizes will also be awarded in the following categories:

     Runners - 1st, 2nd, and 3rd male; 1st, 2nd, and 3rd female

 	Walkers – 1st male, 1st female (Please be aware that any walkers observed running, or admitting to (!), will be reclassified.) 

Prizegiving will be as soon as possible after each event has finished, around 12 noon for the runners, and 1pm for the walkers. 

 

Parking 

As the road past the scout hut can be fairly busy we have made arrangements to use the Loughborough University Holywell Park carpark for event parking where there should be plenty of space (Postcode: LE11 3GR – use West campus entrance from main roundabout on Ashby Road).  Although by road this may seem some distance from the event, by following the marked route through the local estate it is only around a 15 minute walk (1 km / 0.6 miles) to the event HQ.  For safety reasons and to avoid causing problems with local residents we therefore kindly request that competitors use this facility rather than parking on nearby streets.  Please take care when crossing the road to/from the Scout HQ.

The carpark will be open from 8:00 on the day of the event. 

For any people who have entered the event as a 'walker' then there is the option to park at the slightly nearer Nanpantan sports ground off Watermead Lane (LE11 3TN).  However, please be aware that this is a public carpark shared with several sports groups, and there may not be much free space.  To avoid creating problems with other users and local residents, if this carpark is full then please use the university carpark as above. 

 

First Aid and Emergencies 

For any first aid or other emergencies experienced while at the scout HQ, please inform a marshal. 

First aid cover on the course and at the event HQ will be provided by experienced first aiders.   

As sections of the route are rural, rough underfoot, and remote from the road, in the event of an accident or a runner becoming unwell, please stop to provide assistance if necessary, and ensure that a marshal located at one of the road crossings is informed of the situation as soon as possible. 

In the unfortunate situation that you are unable to finish the event and need to retire, please make you way to the nearest road crossing, and inform the marshal located there, who will be able to provide assistance. 

Late entries

If you have any friends who are yet to enter then we will be taking entries up until Saturday evening if we haven't reached our limit (and maybe even on the day).
