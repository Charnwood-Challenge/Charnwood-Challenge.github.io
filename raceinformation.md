## Route

The route starts at the Nanpantan Scout Group HQ in Loughborough, and makes its way across the fields to Woodhouse Eaves on paths and bridleways.  Entrants then tackle the steep climbs over Windmill Hill, Broombriggs, and the Beacon, before heading towards the finish through the Charnwood countryside.

The provisional route can be found here:

Maps of the confirmed route will be available for viewing at the Event HQ on the morning of the event.

As the route is primarily on paths and tracks which may be muddy, rocky and steep, then off-road / trail running shoes with good grip are strongly recommended. 

The route will be partly marked, with signs at key points and tape streamers along the paths, together with marshals at key points.

Marshalls will be positioned at road crossings to help ensure the safety of competitors, but please be aware that they are not permitted to stop traffic, just to indicate when it may be safe to cross.  Please be sure to follow any instructions given. 

Note that there are a few places on the route where there are nettles and brambles along the tracks and, while we have tidied up the worst of these, if this is likely to cause a problem we suggest that you wear long leg running tights, or trousers for the walkers.

### Dogs 

**Sorry, but as the route passes through several fields where livestock may be present, including private land, unfortunately dogs are not permitted to accompany runners or walkers competing in the event.**

# How to Enter

Main event entry fee is £13 (affiliated) for runners and walkers, or £15 (unaffiliated).


# On the Day

## Registration 

Registration will open at 8:30 for collection of race numbers and any last minute queries. 

## Start Times 

The start times for the event are as follows: 

 9:00  Walkers 

 10:00 Runners - There may be staggered starts between 09:30 and 10:30, subject to any COVID rules.

## Water 

We will review the water station situation in relation to COVID guidelines and will assess closer to the event. 

If COVID guidelines permit, there will be a water station just over halfway round the course (at approximately 5.5 miles / 9 km) on the approach to the Broombriggs carpark. 

If the weather is expected to be unseasonably hot then additional water stations will be provided at other locations. 


## Refreshments 

Provision of refreshments will be reviewed closer to the event and confirmed in accordance with COVID Guidelines.

If COVID guidelines permit, refreshments will be available to purchase at the Scout HQ, including tea, coffee, soft drinks, cake, and a selection of other snacks. 


## Changing and Toilets 

Toilets will be provided at the event HQ (portaloos if required due to entry numbers), however no changing facilities will be provided.

During the event itself, please note that there are public toilets at several points close to the route (i.e. top or bottom of Beacon Hill, Woodhouse Eaves village), although a short detour may be needed – please ask a marshal for directions if necessary. 


## Bag Storage 

Secure bag storage will be situated in the scout HQ, manned by members of the scout group. You will need to show your race number to pick up your bag after the race. 

## Prizes 

Prizes will be awarded in categories to include: 

Runners - 1st man, 1st lady 
Walkers – 1st man, 1st lady (Please be aware that any walkers observed running, or admitting to (!), will be reclassified.) If COVID Guidelines allow there will be a Prizegiving ceremony, as soon as possible after each event has finished. 

## Parking 

As the road past the scout hut can be fairly busy there is the option to park at the nearby Nanpantan sports ground off Watermead Lane (LE11 3TN). However, please be aware that this is a public carpark shared with several sports groups, and there may not be much free space, so please park considerately. 

If you do park on local streets to attend the event, then please make sure not to create a traffic hazard, or to block the access for any local residents. There will be no parking for competitors on the road immediately outside the scout HQ for safety reasons and to ensure access is clear for race organisers and first aid etc. 


## First Aid and Emergencies 

For any first aid or other emergencies experienced while at the scout HQ, please inform a marshal. First aid cover on the course and at the event HQ will be provided by experienced first aiders.  

As sections of the route are rural, rough underfoot, and remote from the road, in the event of an accident or a runner becoming unwell, please stop to provide assistance if necessary, and ensure that a marshal located at one of the road crossings is informed of the situation as soon as possible.

In the unfortunate situation that you are unable to finish the event and need to retire, please make you way to the nearest road crossing, and inform the marshal located there, who will be able to provide assistance.

## Race Permit & Insurance 

ARC Permit applied for – details to be confirmed.
