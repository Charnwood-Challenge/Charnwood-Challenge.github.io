## Route

The route is as per previous years (details on the website) with only minor changes coming into the
Beacon Hill Upper Carpark due to the new fence which has been installed (and watch out for a couple of
low tree branches on the Permissive Path!).
Please note that the Beacon Hill Sculpture trail will still be in place on the day of the event, on the
section of the route between Beacon Hill Upper Car Park and Deans Lane. By all means enjoy the works
of art as you pass by, but please be mindful of and courteous to other members of the public when
running/walking through this area and allow sufficient space when passing anyone.
Ideally we would like all participants to be safely back at the Scout HQ by 1pm so we can stand down the
marshal team, who will have been out on the course since early that morning. While we would like
everyone to be able to enjoy the event and take on the challenge at their level, please bear this in mind
(and we kindly request that you wait until after you have finished before stopping for lunch!).

### Dogs 

Sorry, but as the route passes through several fields where livestock may be present, including private
land, unfortunately dogs are not permitted to accompany runners or walkers competing in the event.

# How to Enter

Main event entry fee is £15 (affiliated) for runners and walkers, or £17 (unaffiliated).
Junior Challenge is £4 and entry on the day at the event headquarters.


# On the Day

## Registration 

Registration will open at 8:30 for collection of race numbers and any last-minute queries.
Please pin your number to your front and make sure it can be clearly seen by the marshals.
All walkers will be asked to provide the number of a mobile phone which they will be carrying and which
could be used to contact them during the event, if required.
Any Junior Walkers (under 16) must remain with their parent/guardian for the duration of the event.
Note that there may be photographs taken by the marshals or members of the scout group during the
event which may be used for future publicity of the event. If you do not wish your photograph to be
used for this purpose then please make this known at Registration so your race number can be noted. 

## Start Times 

The start times for the event are as follows: 

 9:00  Walkers 

 10:00 Runners

 10:15 Fun Run
 
 Both will be a mass start, with a short briefing 5 minutes beforehand.
 
## Water 

There will be a water station just over halfway round the course (at approximately 5.5 miles / 9 km) on
the approach to the Broombriggs carpark. If you think you may need more that what will be provided at
this stop then we suggest you carry a bottle or similar for the event.
Water will also be available at the finish. Although this may be using disposable cups, if you are able to
bring your own reusable water bottle then we will happily refill it for you. 


## Refreshments 

Refreshments will be available to purchase at the Scout HQ, including tea, coffee, soft drinks, cakes, and
a selection of other snacks.


## Changing and Toilets 

Toilets will be provided at the event HQ, however no separate changing facilities are available.
During the event itself, please note that there are public toilets at several points close to the route (i.e.
top or bottom of Beacon Hill, Woodhouse Eaves village), although a short detour may be needed –
please ask a marshal for directions if necessary and advise them of your race number and that you need
to deviate from the event route so we can track your location.


## Bag Storage 

Secure bag storage will be situated in the Scout HQ building, manned by members of the scout group.
You will need to show your race number to pick up your bag after the race.

## Prizes 

Prizes will be awarded in categories to include:
Runners – 1 st man, 1 st lady, 2 nd man; 2 nd lady, 3 rd man, 3 rd lady
Walkers – 1 st man, 1 st lady
(Please be aware that any walkers observed running, or admitting to (!), will be reclassified.)

## Parking 

Please car share if driving to the event, where possible.
There will be no parking for competitors on the road immediately outside the scout HQ for safety
reasons and to ensure access is clear for race organisers and first aid etc. As Nanpantan Road can be
fairly busy there is the option to park at the nearby Nanpantan sports ground off Watermead Lane (LE11
3TN). However, please be aware that this is a public carpark shared with several sports groups, and
there may not be much free space, so please park considerately.
If you do park on local streets to attend the event, then please make sure not to create a traffic hazard,
or to block the access for any local residents.
For those competitors with the energy to cycle to/from the event (!) there is space at the HQ for cycles
to be parked, and although there will be members of the event team around during the day this will be
at the owner’s risk.


## First Aid and Emergencies 

For any first aid or other emergencies experienced while at the Scout HQ, please inform a marshal. First
aid cover on the course and at the event HQ will be provided by experienced first aiders.
As sections of the route are rural, rough underfoot, and remote from the road, in the event of an
accident or a runner becoming unwell please stop to provide assistance if necessary, and ensure that a
marshal located at one of the road crossings is informed of the situation as soon as possible.
In the unfortunate situation that you are unable to finish the event and need to retire, please make your
way to the nearest road crossing, and inform the marshal located there, who will be able to provide
assistance. We also ask that you report to the finish before you leave the event.

## Race Permit & Insurance 

ARC Permit applied for – details to be confirmed.
