The route starts at the Nanpantan Scout Group HQ in Loughborough, and makes its way across the fields to Woodhouse Eaves on paths and bridleways.  Entrants then tackle the steep climbs over Windmill Hill, Broombriggs, and the Beacon, before heading towards the finish through the Charnwood countryside.

The provisional route can be found here: <https://charnwoodchallenge.me/Leaflet/#14/52.7366/-1.2375> or www.plotaroute.com/route/662696

Maps of the confirmed route will be available for viewing at the Event HQ on the morning of the event.

## Water

There will be a water station just over halfway round the course (at approximately 5.5 miles / 9 km) on the approach to the Broombriggs carpark.  If the weather is expected to be unseasonably hot then additional water stations will be provided at other locations.
Water will also be provided at the Scout HQ after the finish.
