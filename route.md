The route starts at the Nanpantan Scout Group HQ in Loughborough, and makes its way across the fields to Woodhouse Eaves on paths and bridleways.  Entrants then tackle the steep climbs over Windmill Hill, Broombriggs, and the Beacon, before heading towards the finish through the Charnwood countryside.

Maps of the confirmed route will be available for viewing at the Event HQ on the morning of the event. 

As the route is primarily on paths and tracks which may be muddy, rocky and steep, then off-road / trail running shoes with good grip are strongly recommended. 

The route will be partly marked, with signs at key points and tape streamers along the paths, together with marshals at key points.

Marshalls will be positioned at road crossings to help ensure the safety of competitors, but please be aware that they are not permitted to stop traffic, just to indicate when it may be safe to cross.  Please be sure to follow any instructions given. 

Note that there are a few places on the route where there are nettles and brambles along the tracks and, while we have tidied up the worst of these, if this is likely to cause a problem we suggest that you wear long leg running tights, or trousers for the walkers.

## Water

There will be a water station just over halfway round the course (at approximately 5.5 miles / 9 km) on the approach to the Broombriggs carpark.  If the weather is expected to be unseasonably hot then additional water stations will be provided at other locations.
Water will also be provided at the Scout HQ after the finish.
